### 必讀事項

我們將透過 DSiWare 遊戲應用程式中所存在的一項安全性漏洞自您的裝置中安裝 boot9strap。

為達成這點，我們將透過一項稱為 Seedminer 的工具來計算您裝置中所持有的 DSiWare 加密金鑰 (`movable.sed`)。 我們將透過此 DSiWare 加密金鑰解密任一相容的 DSiWare 以植入一項安全性漏洞好讓我們執行任何想要的程式 (漏洞種類視您的主機區域而定)。

假如該金鑰是亂數產生的，以現在的電腦技術而言將無法破解該加密金鑰。 好消息是該金鑰的前半段 (`movable_part1.sed`) 其實跟您裝置的好友代碼是有相關性的。透過這點，我們將能破解該金鑰。 如果想知道 Seedminer 怎麼運作的，請見該[投影片](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3)。

請注意，該工具將需要一台擁有較強顯卡的電腦以破解您裝置所持有的加密金鑰。 如果您並沒有像這樣的設備，網路上將有自願性的服務幫您破解此金鑰。

### 操作說明

#### 第一節 — 相容性測試

While these tests are not strictly necessary to perform the Seedminer exploit, the follow-up exploits to this do require this test to be performed and it would be a waste of time and effort to perform Seedminer without the ability to use the other exploits.

There are two different methods for building on the Seedminer exploit (described in more detail at the bottom of this page), so even if one of these test fails you can still use another method as long as the other does not fail.

#### DS 網路設定測試 (用於 Fredtool)

1. 進入『系統設定 (System Settings)』中的『網路設定 (Internet Settings)』並選取『任天堂 DS 連線 (Nintendo DS Connections)』
1. 按『OK』
1. 如果『Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Setup』選單跳出則代表測試成功
  + If the screen stays black or appears to freeze, the test has failed and you will not be able to use the Fredtool method which requires a functioning DS Internet Settings
1. 退出此選單

#### DS 下載通信測試 (用於 Frogtool)

1. 啟動『下載通信（Download Play）」程式 (![]({{ "/images/download-play-icon.png" | absolute_url }}){: height="24px" width="24px"})
1. Select "Nintendo DS"
1. If your device loads into a "Download software via DS Download Play" menu, the test was successful
  + If the screen stays black or appears to freeze, the test has failed and you will not be able to use the Frogtool method which requires a functioning DS Download Play
1. 退出此選單

#### 第二節 — 準備工作

1. 將 SD 卡插入至電腦中
1. Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + If you see multiple folders like this, perform the following:
  + Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder to `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS`
  + Reinsert your SD card into your device and power on your device
  + Wait for the device to generate the SD card data
  + Power off your device and reinsert your SD card into your computer
  + Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
  + Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
  + Delete the `Nintendo 3DS` folder
  + Rename the `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` folder to `Nintendo 3DS`
1. Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later
  + This folder name is also known as your "ID0"
1. 啟動您的主機
1. 開啟您的好友清單 (HOME 主選單中最上方的[橘色笑臉圖示]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}))
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your console cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section III - Seedminer

1. Open [Bruteforce Movable](https://bruteforcemovable.com/) on your computer
  + This site can automate the retrieval of `movable_part1.sed` (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer)
  + If you already have access to a 3DS capable of launching the Homebrew Launcher, you can manually retrieve your `movable_part1.sed` using that device by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section1) instructions
  + If you already have access to a PC with a powerful graphics card, you can manually calculate your `movable.sed` using it by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section2) instructions
  + If the automated service is nonfunctional and you cannot do one or both of those manually, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the "Your friend code" field
1. Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the "Your ID0" field
1. 完成『我不是機器人』之驗證
1. Select "Go"
  + If the site immediately goes to step 4, download your `movable.sed` file and continue with the next section.
1. When prompted, use the "Register Friend" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console
1. Wait for the site to update
  + If it does not, wait a few minutes before refreshing the page once
1. Once the site processes your information, you will be given the option to "Continue" or "Do another device". Click the green "Continue" button
1. Wait for the remainder of the process to complete
  + This is usually fast (1-5 minutes) but in some cases, can take up to half an hour.
  + During this process, the bot you added may not show up on your 3ds. As long as the website updates, this is not an issue.
  + If you are still waiting after half an hour, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. When the process has completed, download your `movable.sed` file from the site
  + Keep this file as you will need it in the upcoming pages

### 方法

___

#### Seedminer + Fredtool

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare eShop title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application. 於使用此指南時，您必須先擁有 (或下載/購買) eShop 中的 DSiWare 遊戲。

This method is compatible with all regions, though only the JPN and USA regions have free DSiWare titles in the eShop.

This method requires that the DS Internet Settings be functioning properly (see the test at the top of this page).

___

#### Seedminer + Steelhax + Frogtool

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to gain access to the Homebrew Launcher using the Steelhax exploit for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Download Play application. This method requires you to already own (or download) the free "Steel Diver: Sub Wars" game from the eShop.

This method is only compatible with the EUR, JPN, and USA regions, and is somewhat more complicated than the above method. It is only recommended to use this method if you have a EUR region device and do not wish to pay for a DSiWare game, or if the above method does not work for you for some reason.

This method requires that the DS Download Play be functioning properly (see the test at the top of this page).
