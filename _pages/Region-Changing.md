title: "Region Changing"
permalink: /region-changing.html

This is add-on section for region changing your arm9loaderhax CFW SysNAND. This is done by installing the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image for the region you want to switch to and modifying your SecureInfo_A file.
{: .notice--primary}

**Region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out of region games and individual [title region emulation](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Options-and-usage).**
{: .notice--info}

This process will unlink your NNID from the system, since it will no longer be compatible with it. NNID's are locked to the region of the device that created them, and cannot be transferred between regions without [a very complex and advanced process](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yifanlu/e80db121d38aceb8cca0e03cefd5853b/raw/3c4dd89869156ca0f945a2791e699acfdb32b510/gistfile1.txt).
{: .notice--warning}

After this process, only **New 3DSs which have never accessed the eShop before** and **any Old 3DSs** will be able to access the eShop after creating a new NNID on their new region. Region changed New 3DSs that have already accessed the eShop on their original region cannot create a new NNID and access the eShop on their new region!
{: .notice--warning}

Note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably still not work for devices that it should work for. This is entirely to do with Nintendo's servers, and I really do not have any control over it.
{: .notice--warning}

Region changing using ctrtransfer (which this method uses) seems to cause reboot patches to break. The cause for this is unknown, but for now Old 3DS users will be unable to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, and PokÃ©mon Sun / Moon).
{: .notice--warning}

**You MUST have already installed arm9loaderhax + Luma3DS to use this.**

#### What you need

{% include addfiles.html %} 

#### Instructions

**Some consoles have a `SecureInfo_B` instead of `SecureInfo_A`; this is fine and you should use `SecureInfo_B` for the relevant steps.**    

##### Section I - Prep work

1. Copy `GodMode9.bin` from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card and rename `GodMode9.bin` in `/luma/payloads/` to `up_GodMode9.bin`
2. Copy `Decrypt9WIP.bin` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card and rename `Decrypt9WIP.bin` to `x_Decrypt9WIP.bin`
3. Copy the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image `.bin` and `.bin.sha` from the ctrtransfer `.zip` to the `/files9/` folder on your SD card
4. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS

##### Section II - Backup tickets and config save

5. Press (Start) then hold (X) to reboot into arm9loaderhax Decrypt9     
6. Go to "Ticket/Titlekey Options", then select "Ticket Dump (SysNAND)"
7. Press (Select) to eject your SD card, then put it in your computer
8. Delete all `.tik` files in the `/files9/` folder that **do not** start with "00-"
9. Leave all the `.tik` files that do start with "00-" in the folder
10. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS, then press (B) to go back to the Main Menu
11. Go to "SysNAND Options", then "System Save Dump", then select "Dump configsave.bin"

##### Section III - ctrtransfer

6. Go to "SysNAND Options", then "CTRNAND Transfer", then "Auto CTRNAND Transfer"
7. Select the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image when prompted by pressing (A)
8. **Backup SysNAND to `NANDmin.bin` when prompted by pressing (A)**
9. Allow the transfer process to proceed automatically, this may take some time
10. Once the transfer is complete, press Select to eject your SD card
11. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `NANDmin.bin` and `NANDmin.bin.sha` from the `/files9/` folder on your SD card to a safe location
  + Make backups in multiple locations
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future
  + **Your backup should match one of the sizes on [this](nand-size) page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!**
12. Delete the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image `.bin` and `.bin.sha` from the `/files9/` folder on your SD card after copying it
13. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS

##### Section IV - Editing SecureInfo

1. Press (Start) then hold (Up) to reboot into arm9loaderhax GodMode9     
2. Navigate to `SYSNAND CTRNAND` -> `rw` -> `sys`
3. Press (Y) on `SecureInfo_A` to copy it
4. Press (Y) to paste a copy of `SecureInfo_A`
5. Select "Copy path(s)"
6. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND writing, then input the key combo given
7. Select "Choose new name"
8. Use the D-Pad to rename the file to `SecureInfo_C`, pressing (A) when you're done (overwrite any existing `SecureInfo_C`)
9. Scroll down to the `SecureInfo_C` you just pasted
10. Press (A) on `SecureInfo_C` then select "Show in Hexeditor"

    - "02" : EUR
16. Press (B) to exit edit mode, then save changes, then press (B) again to return to the directory
17. You should see both a `SecureInfo_A` and `SecureInfo_C` if everything was done properly. (`SecureInfo_C` is used in place of `SecureInfo_A` when using Luma3DS if it detects the file on boot)

Old 3DSs / 2DSs may need to format (using TinyFormat or the System Settings) to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, or Pokemon Sun/Moon).
{: .notice--info}

Formatting a device following a ctrtransfer *without restoring the config save* can cause screen brightness / flickering issues. See [this](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/issues/794).
