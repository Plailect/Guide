Soundhax is compatible with versions 9.0.0 through 11.3.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.
{: .notice--info}

Ensure your device's Wireless Communication is turned on as udsploit (used in the next page) will need the wireless module to be active to function, and some devices (New 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS) cannot adjust the Wireless Communication setting from the Homebrew Launcher. Wireless Communication only has to be on; connecting it to an access point is not required.

Note that Cart Updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. Cart Updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.
<br><br>
This means that using a Cart Update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<7.0.0 for Old 3DSs in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break [Soundhax](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))! You will need an [alternate method](homebrew-launcher-(alternatives)) of entering the Homebrew Launcher!

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Mergeți în `/SDCARD`, apoi apăsați "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + Acest lucru ar putea necesita multe încercări
  + Dacă se blochează, închideți consola forțat ținând apăsat butonul de Power și încercați din nou
  + If you get a red screen, ensure you copied _the contents of_ the `starter` folder to the root of your SD card
