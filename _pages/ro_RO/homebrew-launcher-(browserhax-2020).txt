### Lectură obligatorie

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

Aceste instrucțiuni funcționează pe consolele din regiunea SUA, Europa, Japonia și Coreea, indicate de literele U, E, J, sau K după versiunea de sistem. If you have a Taiwan or China region console as indicated by the letters T or C after the system version, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

### Ce aveți nevoie

* Cea mai nouă versiune de [Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* The latest release archive of BrowserHax [[for Old 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/old-browserhax/releases/latest) / [for New 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/new-browserhax/releases/latest)]
  + New/Old refers to the model of your console. If you are unsure of which model you have, consult [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/newold.png)
* An active WiFi connection on your console

### Instrucțiuni

#### Secțiunea I - Preparații

1. Power off your console and remove the SD card
1. Connect the SD card to your computer
1. Copy `boot.3dsx` from the Homebrew Launcher release to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. In the BrowserHax release archive, open the folder corresponding to your console's region
  + Your console's region can be found in the final letter of the system version in System Settings: U is USA, E is EUROPE, J is JAPAN, and K is KOREA
1. Copy the `3ds` folder, `browserhax_hblauncher_ropbin_payload.bin` and `arm11code.bin` from there to the root of your SD card
  + You should now have a `Nintendo 3DS` folder, a `3ds` folder and the two `.bin` files on your root directory

#### Section II - BrowserHax

1. Open [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/hax.png) in a new tab or window on your computer
1. Safely remove your SD card from your computer and put it back in your console
1. Power on your console and ensure it is connected to an active WiFi network
1. From the HOME Menu, press the Left Shoulder and Right Shoulder buttons together
  + This should open a QR Scanner. If it does not, USM (the next part of getting custom firmware) will not work for you. You will need to use [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + If you need to type out the URL, it is `https://zoogie.github.io/web/nbhax/`
1. Use the QR scanner to scan the QR code you opened in the first step
1. Tap the "PROCEED TO HAXX" button
1. Așteptați până când procesul este terminat

1. În cazul în care exploit-ul a mers, dispozitivul va încărca Homebrew Launcher
  + If you see an error stating that no applications were found, ensure that you have copied the `3ds` folder from the BrowserHax release archive to the root of your SD card, then try this section again
