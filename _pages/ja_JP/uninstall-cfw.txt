### Required Reading

Use a [save manager](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} to backup any saves for these unsigned (illegitimate) games you care about.

This will not affect your NNID, any legitimately purchased games, or any saves for those legitimately purchased games.
