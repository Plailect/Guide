**Nella versione originale di questo post, avevo deciso di eliminare tutti i dettagli che avrebbero potuto rivelare l'identità della vittima. Purtroppo, lo sforzo è stato reso vano, visto che la vittima ha risposto direttamente nel thread (leggibile su [questa pagina](https://imgur.com/gallery/un69v)).**

**Non essendo più possibile proteggere la privacy della vittima, è possibile trovare delle prove contro Dazzozo [qui](https://0bin.net/paste/n-tGGoZUNr8iKDpu#JnORnwh6Cdfd9S8hJp3wWLxUnmJt7HQxV0DsjdOz45L), [qui](https://gist.github.com/daeken/d2540e3fc355b5648442eb190dd8de84), [qui](https://imgur.com/gallery/4Y35B), e [qui](https://web.archive.org/web/20080312220606/http://dazzozo.com/profile.php?lookup=1) ([mirror](https://imgur.com/gallery/NtyOJ) per l'età).**

Non era mia intenzione scrivere questo post, ma ho deciso di farlo lo stesso per la sicurezza di questa comunità.

Circa tre settimane fa, precisamente il 2 Aprile, sono apparse in forma di chat esplicite delle prove compromettenti riguardo un membro ventiduenne della comunità hacking per 3DS, Wii U e Switch, [Dazzozo](https://dazzozo.com/) ([Github](https://github.com/Dazzozo)), nelle quali viene riportato come quest'ultimo sia stato coinvolto in una relazione intima a distanza con un minore. He, more specifically, intended on leaving the country in order to have sexual relations with this minor which is in clear violation of [the relevant sex tourism laws](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/15). When confronted, Dazzozo made no attempt to deny this behavior; instead, he stated that he was unaware that the sex tourism laws applied. He has since been banned from the place where this situation occurred, and all information has been turned over to the relevant authorities.

This is not the first time something like this has happened in the 3DS hacking community. Just recently, Cruel\`, a well-known developer in the community, was convicted on child pornography charges and will be spending [20 years in prison](http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/gwinnett-man-convicted-of-running-child-porn-site/article_05ad133f-165f-5afe-9714-92fc4445ead1.html) as a result.

I want to be abundantly clear: this type of predatory behavior is indefensible; no form of healthy relationship can develop in a situation where there is a power imbalance as large as that between an adult and a 15-year old. This type of "[grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming)" behavior is extremely damaging to the minors affected by it. They tend to be isolated from friends and have their personality changed to match the one of the adult (which is exactly what happened in this situation). This community has many young members who may not fully understand the dangers of this, and it is our responsibility to keep them safe.

If you have knowledge of unhealthy relationships involving an adult and a minor such as this one, it is our responsibility as community members to come forward and protect the minor, even if they do not yet understand that their relationship is damaging.
