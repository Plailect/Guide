The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints, or methods of launching.
{: .notice}

Soundhax is compatible with versions 9.0.0 through 11.3.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.
{: .notice--info}

Ensure your device's Wireless Communication is turned on as udsploit (used in the next page) will need the wireless module to be active to function, and some devices (New 3DS and 2DS) cannot adjust the Wireless Communication setting from the Homebrew Launcher. Wireless Communication only has to be on; connecting it to an access point is not required.
{: .notice--info}

Note that Cart Updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. Cart Updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza or eShop.
{: .notice--info}

This means that using a Cart Update from a version <9.0.0 will break [Soundhax](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))! You will need an [alternate method](homebrew-launcher-(alternatives)) of entering the Homebrew Launcher!

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Go to `/SDCARD`, then play "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + This may take many tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
  + If you get a red screen, ensure you copied _the contents of_ the `starter` folder to the root of your SD card
