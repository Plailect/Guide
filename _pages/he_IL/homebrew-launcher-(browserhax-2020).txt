### קריאה דרושה

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version. If you have a Taiwan or China region console as indicated by the letters T or C after the system version, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* The latest release archive of BrowserHax [[for Old 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/old-browserhax/releases/latest) / [for New 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/new-browserhax/releases/latest)]
  + New/Old refers to the model of your console. If you are unsure of which model you have, consult [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/newold.png)
* An active WiFi connection on your console
