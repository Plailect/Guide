{: .notice--success}

#### 你需要

* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/latest)
* 自制程序[新手包](http://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip)

#### 操作指南

##### 第一部分 - 准备工作

1. Power off your device
1. 将你的 SD 卡插入到您的计算机
1. 解压缩` starter.zip `，将` starter `文件夹下的所有文件拷贝到你SD卡的根目录中
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `arm9.bin` and `arm11.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device

##### Section II - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. Launch the browser and go to one of the following URL on your device
  + `http://2xrsa.3ds.guide`
  + 如果你的设备是新3DS或者2DS，在降级到了2.1.0系统时无线连接没有开启，你可以将充电器断开并将电池拿下来，等待数秒后再开机，即可重新开启无线连接。
  + If you get the error "This service is not available in your region", use the System Settings to set your device's country to match the NAND region you installed with 2.1.0 CTRTransfer
  + If you forgot to disable parental controls before CTRTransfering or otherwise cannot access wireless settings, note that the device will autoconnect to any network named `attwifi` with no password
  + 如果出现错误，[参见这个问题排查](troubleshooting#ts_browser)
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

##### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all safety checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Your device will boot into boot9strap, then shutdown automatically because it does not yet have a payload to launch
  + Your device will not boot until you continue with the next page's instructions; do not panic, this is normal

___

Note that *New 3DS* users who ended up on 2.1.0 after a CTRTransfer *must* [restore their NAND backup](godmode9-usage#nand_restore) between "Section II - Configuring Luma3DS" and "Section III - Updating the System" of [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup).
