### Required Reading

There are two different methods of installing boot9strap using DSiWare on 11.6.0.

其中一种方法只兼容四个已从eShop撤除的游戏，而另一种方法可以用不少eShop上仍可下载的 DSiWare 游戏。

两种方法都需要两台设备。 One 3DS (or 2DS) must be running boot9strap and is referred to as the *source 3DS*, while the other 3DS (or 2DS) is on stock 11.6.0 and referred to as the *target 3DS*.

Both of these methods will assume that the 3DS running custom firmware is using boot9strap and has completed this guide. 虽然通过其他破解方法破解的源 3DS 也可行，但其超出了本教程的范围。

两种方法的实现都是结合了“固件已知明文分区”的弱点（参见[这里](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws)）和允许DSiWare游戏在整个加密的NAND系统中任意读写的疏忽处。

Both of these methods require you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS or New 2DS -> New 3DS or New 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or Old 2DS -> Old 3DS or Old 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or Old 2DS -> New 3DS or New 2DS   

两台机子必须属于同一地区。
{: .notice--warning} 

In both of these methods, the source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo (details can be found in the instructions)! System Transfers can only be performed once a week per NNID.

### Methods

___

  + "Fieldrunners"

A pirated copy of the game will *not* work, and all of these games have been pulled from the eShop.

This method does not require a hacked source 3DS or a System Transfer. You only need a compatible game on the 3DS you want to hack.
