Soundhax is compatible with versions 9.0.0 through 11.3.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.

Ensure your device's Wireless Communication is turned on and is connected to the internet. OCS (used in the next page) will need to download some files on your device.

Note that Cart Updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. Cart Updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.

This means that using a Cart Update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<7.0.0 for Old 3DSs in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break [Soundhax](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))! Homebrew'ı çalıştırmak için [alternatif bir yöntem](homebrew-launcher-(alternatives)) gerekir!
