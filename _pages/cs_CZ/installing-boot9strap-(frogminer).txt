{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

To install boot9strap on your 11.8.0 device, we exploit an oversight in the security restrictions applied to "DSiWare" applications.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key (`movable.sed`) for your device.

We then use this DSiWare encryption key to decrypt a compatible DSiWare application and inject an exploit into it to run our own code.

If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key (`movable_part1.sed`) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption. For information on how Seedminer works, please see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34â…•c3).

Note that this tool requires a PC with a powerful graphics card to break your device's DSiWare encryption. If you do not have access to one of these, there exists several online helper services where a volunteer running automated software will do this for you.

To use the [magnet](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

To extract the `.7z` and `.rar` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

This process will overwrite your DSiWare game's save file!

1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section II - Seedminer

1. Open [Bruteforce Movable](https://bruteforcemovable.com/) on your computer
  + This site can automate the retrieval of `movable_part1.sed` (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer)
  + If you already have access to a 3DS capable of launching the Homebrew Launcher, you can manually retrieve your `movable_part1.sed` using that device by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section1) instructions
  + If you already have access to a PC with a powerful graphics card, you can manually calculate your `movable.sed` using it by following [these](https://jisagi.github.io/SeedminerGuide/seedminerSelf/#section2) instructions
  + If the automated service is nonfunctional and you cannot do one or both of those manually, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the "Your friend code" field
1. Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the "Your ID0" field
1. Complete the "I'm not a robot" captcha
1. Select "Go"
1. When prompted, use the "Register Friend" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console
1. Wait for the site to update
  + If it does not, refresh the page
1. Select "Continue"
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + This can take a while (up to an hour in some cases)
  + If you are still waiting after an hour, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. When the process has completed, download your `movable.sed` file from the site
