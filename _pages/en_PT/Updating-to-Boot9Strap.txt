This page is for existing arm9loaderhax users to update their devices to boot9strap.
{: .notice--info}

All future releases of Luma3DS will only be made in the `.firm` format, which will only be compatible with boot9strap and sighax. This means that to continue receiving the latest updates of Luma3DS, you should use this page to update your installation.
{: .notice--info}

If you have a PIN set on Luma, you must temporarily turn it off to do these steps, or you will get an "OTP Crypto Fail" error. Ye can re-enable th' PIN after th' update.
{: .notice--warning}

{% capture notice-1 %}

If you have the software "3dsafe" installed, you must remove it to do these steps, or you will get an "OTP Crypto Fail" error.
<br><br>
To do this, extract [the latest release of arm9loaderhax](https://github.com/AuroraWright/arm9loaderhax/releases) (the payload files) to a folder named `a9lh` on the root of your SD card, then boot 3dsafe, input your pin and hold down the last key when you do. From there, while holding this key, press (X) to launch the integrated SafeA9LHInstaller, then press (Select) to "update" to standard arm9loaderhax.

To use the [magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)
{: .notice--success}

#### What ye need

Note that the following required file named `secret_sector.bin` is the same one that was found in the various `data_input.zip` file versions. If you already have that file on your disk somewhere, you can use that one instead of downloading the one below.
{: .notice--info}

Note that `secret_sector.bin` is needed to revert the arm9loaderhax exploit, which is why it is not needed for the installation of boot9strap on a stock console.
