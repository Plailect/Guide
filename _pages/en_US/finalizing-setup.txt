#### Overview of steps

{% capture notice-2 %}

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload in the FIRM format. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [AuroraWright](https://github.com/AuroraWright/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

During this process, we also setup programs such as the following:    

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games and applications)* **installed to Health & Safety**
+  **Themely** *(installs custom themes)* installed as a 3dsx
+  **Luma3DS Updater** *(updates your CFW installation easily)* installed as a 3dsx
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*

  + **KOR:** `OLD-11-4-0-37-KOR.bin`
  + **USA:** `OLD-11-4-0-37-USA.bin`

1. If your device is on a version between 3.0.0 and 4.5.0 (inclusive), your device will not boot until you manually download the required firmware:
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/00000056) and rename it to `firmware.bin`
  + Download [this file](http://nus.cdn.c.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/0004013800000002/cetk)
  + Copy `firmware.bin` and `cetk` to the `/luma/` folder on your SD card
  + Delete both of these files after updating your device later in these instructions
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device

##### Section II - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Boot your device to enter the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](https://3ds.guide/troubleshooting#ts_sys_b9s)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:    
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get a black screen, just continue to the next section   

##### Section III - Updating the System

*If, while following a previous version of this guide, you CTRTransfered your *New 3DS* to 2.1.0, now is the time to [restore your NAND backup](https://3ds.guide/godmode9-usage#nand_restore) before doing this section.*

*If, before following this guide, you already had an EmuNAND setup and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, now is the time to [follow Move EmuNAND](https://3ds.guide/move-emunand) before doing this section.*

1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + Updates while using B9S + Luma (what you have) are safe
  + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "auto"
  + If this still gives you an error and your NAND is below 9.2.0, [follow 9.2.0 CTRTransfer](https://3ds.guide/9.2.0-ctrtransfer), then try updating again

##### Section IV - Injecting FBI

1. Reboot holding (Start) during boot to launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to `[0:] SDCARD` -> `cias`
1. Press (A) on `FBI.cia` to select it, then select "CIA image options...", then select "Mount image to drive"
1. Press (A) on the `.app` file, then select "NCCH image options", then select "Inject to H&S"
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing, then input the key combo given
1. Press (A) to continue
1. Press (Start) to reboot your device
1. If you still launch to the stock Health & Safety app and have downgraded with Gateway in the past, [follow this troubleshooting guide](https://3ds.guide/troubleshooting#gw_fbi)

##### Section V - Installing CIAs

1. Launch DSPDump
1. Once it has completed, press (B) to return to the homebrew launcher

##### Section VII - Restore Health and Safety

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `nand.bin` from the `/gm9out/` folder on your SD card to a safe location on your computer
  + Make backups in multiple locations (such as online file storage)
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot

___

You can now use Luma3DS Updater to update your Luma3DS to the latest version just by opening it from the Homebrew Launcher and pressing (A).     
This is not the same thing as a System Update; it just downloads and extracts the newest Luma3DS files.
This will only update the Luma3DS files on your SD card. If you boot your device without an SD card, it will use the version you placed in CTRNAND.    

You will now boot Luma3DS CFW SysNAND by default.    
You can now hold (Select) on boot to launch the Luma3DS configuration menu.    
You can now hold (Start) on boot to launch the Luma3DS chainloader menu (note that the Luma3DS chainloader menu is only displayed if there is more than one payload detected).
You can now hold (Start) + (Select) + (X) on boot to dump the ARM11 bootrom (`boot11.bin`), the ARM9 bootrom (`boot9.bin`), and your console unique OTP (`OTP.bin`) to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card (note that this will not have any kind of prompt or message).

Remove any extra files and folders from the root of your SD card that are *not* in the following image:
