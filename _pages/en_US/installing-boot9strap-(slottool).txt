### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to gain access to the Homebrew Launcher using the PicHaxx exploit for the purposes of injecting an exploited WiFi profile.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

If your device already has access to the Homebrew Launcher (whether through PicHaxx or another exploit), replace your current otherapp with an otherapp for your console's region/revision from the [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/releases/latest) release `.zip` located in the `otherapps_with_CfgS` folder.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/releases/latest)

1. Copy `slotTool.3dsx` from the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the `3ds` folder

1. Copy the otherapp payload for your console's region and revision from the `otherapps_with_CfgS` folder located in the unSAFE_MODE `.zip` to the root of your SD card and rename it to `otherapp.bin`
