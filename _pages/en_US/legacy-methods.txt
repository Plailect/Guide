### Required Reading

There have been multiple improvements and advancements to methods for installing CFW over the last short while.

For this reason, it is recommended you use the most up-to-date method found on the [Get Started](get-started) page.

However, "legacy" or outdated methods are kept here for various purposes. They will require that you have done [Seedminer](seedminer) first.

If you need help, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for assistance.

If the system is found to be unminable, and formatting the console does not change that, you will either need to follow [BrowserHax 2020](homebrew-launcher-(browserhax-2020)) or follow an All Versions method.
