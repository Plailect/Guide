### Required Reading

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

If your device already has access to the Homebrew Launcher (whether through BrowserHax, Pichaxx or another exploit), you can skip to [USM](installing-boot9strap-(hbl-usm)).

### New, Old and Region

To use this guide you will need to know if your console is "New" or "Old", and what region it is from.

1. Open [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/newold.png) in a new tab or window on your computer.
  + If your console has Start and Select in the bottom right as circular buttons, it is a New console.
  + If your console has Start and Select under the touch screen as rectangular buttons, it is an Old console.
1. Remember which designation (New or Old) your console falls under. You will need to know this later.
1. Power on your console.
1. Open System Settings.
1. Look at the top screen.
1. In the bottom right of the top screen, you will see a firmware version string, followed by a letter. This letter is your region.
  + E designates Europe/Oceania.
  + U designates USA/South America.
  + J designates Japan.
  + Any letter NOT listed here is not compatible with this method.
1. Remember your region designation. You will need to know this later.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* If using a "NEW" console: the latest release zip file of [New BrowserHax](https://github.com/zoogie/new-browserhax/releases/latest)
* If using an "OLD" console: the latest release zip file of [Old BrowserHax](https://github.com/zoogie/old-browserhax/releases/latest)
* An active WiFi connection on your console

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Copy `boot.3dsx` from the Homebrew Launcher release to the root of your SD card
1. Unzip the BrowserHax folder
1. Inside the BrowserHax folder, open the folder which corresponds to your region (`EUROPE`, `JAPAN` or `USA`)
1. Copy both of these files to the root of your SD card
  + if you do not see a file extension, do not add one

#### Section II - Updating the System

1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + This is to ensure your browser version is compatible with this exploit
  + The updater may display a message saying "Your system is up to date" instead of updating. This is normal if you are already up to date; continue with the next section
  + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "auto"

#### Section III - BrowserHax

1. Open [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/hax.png) in a new tab or window on your computer
1. Power on your console and ensure it is connected to an active WiFi network
1. From the HOME Menu, press the Left Shoulder and Right Shoulder buttons together
  + This should open a QR Scanner. If it does not, this method will not work for you. You will need to use a [legacy method](legacy-methods)
1. Use the QR scanner to scan the QR code you opened in the first step
1. Tap or click the "PROCEED TO HAXX" button
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + If it displays a yellow screen, power your console off, then try again from step 2
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded the Homebrew Launcher
1. Power off your console
