### Required Reading

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

If your device already has access to the Homebrew Launcher (whether through BrowserHax, Pichaxx or another exploit), you can skip to [USM](installing-boot9strap-(hbl-usm)). Note that this method requires that your Left and Right Shoulder buttons work.

### Console Model and Region

To use this guide you will need to know if your console is "New" or "Old", and what region it is from.

1. Open System Settings.
1. Look at the top screen.
1. In the bottom right of the top screen, you will see a firmware version string, followed by a letter. This letter is your region.
  + E designates EUROPE.
  + U designates USA.
  + J designates JAPAN.
  + Any letter NOT listed here is not compatible with this method.
1. Remember your region designation. You will need to know this later.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* If using an "OLD" console: the latest release archive of [Old BrowserHax](https://github.com/zoogie/old-browserhax/releases/latest)
* If using a "NEW" console: the latest release archive of [New BrowserHax](https://github.com/zoogie/new-browserhax/releases/latest)
  + New/Old refers to the model of your console. If you are unsure, consult [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/newold.png)
* An active WiFi connection on your console

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Copy `boot.3dsx` from the Homebrew Launcher release to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Copy `browserhax_hblauncher_ropbin_payload.bin` and `arm11code.bin` from the folder corresponding to your console's region to the root of your SD card
  + If you are unsure of your console's region, you can identify it by the final letter of the version string in System Settings. U is USA, E is EUROPE and J is JAPAN.

#### Section II - Updating the System

1. Update your device by going to System Settings, then "Other Settings", then going all the way to the right and using "System Update"
  + This is to ensure your browser version is compatible with this exploit
  + The updater may display a message saying "Your system is up to date" instead of updating. This is normal if you are already up to date; continue with the next section
  + If this gives you an error, set your DNS settings to "auto"

#### Section III - BrowserHax

1. Open [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/hax.png) in a new tab or window on your computer
1. Power on your console and ensure it is connected to an active WiFi network
1. From the HOME Menu, press the Left Shoulder and Right Shoulder buttons together
  + This should open a QR Scanner. If it does not, USM (the next part of getting custom firmware) will not work for you. You will need to use a [legacy method](legacy-methods)
  + If you need to type out the URL, it is `https://zoogie.github.io/web/nbhax/`
1. Use the QR scanner to scan the QR code you opened in the first step
1. Tap the "PROCEED TO HAXX" button
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + If it displays a yellow screen, power your console off, then try this section again
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded the Homebrew Launcher
  + You may see an error stating that no applications were found. This is not relevant at this time
1. Power off your console
