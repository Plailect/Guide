title: "Flashing ntrboot (3DS-alternate)"
---

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

Note that this process will render a flashcart un-useable unless you already have a backup from an outside source. 

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
