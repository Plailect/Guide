    title: '<b>On April 24 2017, at approximately 5:00pm EST, the head moderators (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Seamus9999">s_99</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadfracture99">LOCAP</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/34895348573857348759">Clozure</a>) of the popular subreddit /r/3dshacks censored a post exposing a child predator in the 3DS, Wii U, and Switch hacking communities.<br><br>This post, <a href="https://0bin.net/paste/qK1vWjClOqWFYOSJ#Ba53hgBZMDzJPVWUbJ9e5w139KS2i4daFc7cyQYR+bi">made with the staff approval after much bickering</a>, received a score of 417 with an 80% upvote rate, and clearly had the support of the community behind it. This was not a rash post of a sole developer, but rather had the support of the staff of various developer groups.<br><br>These moderators were entrusted to keep the community safe, but instead they attempted cover up the issue. <a href="https://0bin.net/paste/eBQtFS1iI-oUZ+Hi#LnzRA87qPu-r+3YfuVsSuBpQqtbgRznW3aWuls+XWJr">Some members of the staff did not want the community to be made aware at all</a>. Because of this censorship, I will no longer be associated with the /r/3dshacks subreddit or IRC until there is a change in leadership.<br><br>A post explaning the events (with additional information and evidence) can be found <a href="recent-community-events"><i>here</i></a>. A full archive of the removed thread can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/un69v"><i>here</i></a>. The original (now removed) thread can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/674ik7/"><i>here</i></a>.<br><br>I would like to formally apologize to the moderator <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dubyadud">dubyadud</a>, whose legitimate apology I had assumed was damage control on behalf of the moderator team. The deletion of a pre-discussed post this important felt like a betrayal of trust, and as such I was lumping all the moderators together.<br><br>No, this guide will not be deleted. This notice will be removed when it is appropriate to do so. It is not a "witch hunt" when evidence is provided.</b>'
